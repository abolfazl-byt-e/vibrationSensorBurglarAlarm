# Vibration Sensor-Based Burglar Alarm with Keypad

This project implements a burglar alarm system using a vibration sensor and a keypad for password input. The vibration sensor detects motion or vibration, and the system responds accordingly with a buzzer alarm.

## How It Works
1. **First Vibration**: When the vibration sensor detects the first vibration, the buzzer sounds briefly and then stops.
2. **Second Vibration**: If the sensor detects a second vibration, the buzzer starts a continuous alarm.
3. **Disabling the Alarm**: The continuous alarm can only be stopped by entering the correct password via the keypad.

## Components Used
- **Vibration Sensor**: Detects motion or vibration events.
- **Buzzer**: Provides audio alerts.
- **Keypad**: Used for entering the password to stop the alarm.

## Applications
- Motion detection for security systems.
- Earthquake detection and alert systems.
- General-purpose vibration monitoring.

## Features
- Dual-stage alert system (brief and continuous alarm).
- Password-protected alarm deactivation.
- Simple and efficient design suitable for small-scale security solutions.
